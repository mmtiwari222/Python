#variables => containers for storing data values
#variables are used to store data values

#variable naming rules =>
#variable names cannot be a keyword
#variable names cannot start with a number
#variable names can only contain alpha-numeric characters, underscores

name = "Madanmohan"
print(name)

num1 = 5
num2 = 10
print(num1 + num2)

a, b, c = 2, 4, 6
print(a, b, c)

a = b = c = 10
print(a, b, c)

#Dynamic typing => where the type of the variable is determined at runtime by the value assigned to it is called dynamic typing
#Static typing => where the type of the variable is determined at compile time means you need to specify the type of the variable when you declare it

#Dynamic Binding => data type can be changed anytime in the program
#Static Binding => data type cannot be changed once declared in the program
